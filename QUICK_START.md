## üîß Troubleshooting

### Keyboard Blocking Input:
‚úÖ **Fixed!** The keyboard now automatically avoids input fields. If issues persist:
- Try tapping the "Hide Keyboard" button
- Tap outside the input area
- Ensure you're running the latest code

### Bluetooth Won't Connect:
1. Verify Bluetooth is enabled in device settings
2. Ensure Arduino is powered on and nearby
3. Check Arduino firmware has BLE enabled
4. **New:** App will auto-retry up to 3 times
5. **New:** Simulated data will appear if real device unavailable

### No Bluetooth Features Available:
- Must use development build: `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android`
- Expo Go does not support `react-native-ble-plx`
- Grant Bluetooth permissions in device settings

### Charts Not Showing:
- Ensure you have workout data (add at least one workout)
- Health data is auto-generated for demonstration
- Charts require `react-native-chart-kit` and `react-native-svg` (already installed)

## üîë Key Code Updates

### Files Modified:
1. **WorkoutScreen.js** - Keyboard handling
2. **BluetoothContext.js** - Connection stability + simulated data
3. **StatsScreen.js** - Complete redesign with interactive charts
4. **WorkoutContext.js** - Health data management

### Bluetooth UUID Configuration:
If connecting to real Arduino device, update these UUIDs in `src/context/BluetoothContext.js`:

```javascript
const NICLA_SENSE_SERVICE_UUID = 'YOUR-SERVICE-UUID-HERE';
const ACCELEROMETER_CHAR_UUID = 'YOUR-CHARACTERISTIC-UUID-HERE';
```

Find these UUIDs in your Arduino firmware code.

## üìä Testing the New Features

### Test Keyboard Fix:
1. Go to Workout tab
2. Tap "+ Add Workout"
3. Tap duration field
4. Verify you can see the input field and preview above keyboard
5. Type a number, verify preview updates
6. Tap "Hide Keyboard" button
7. Verify keyboard dismisses

### Test Bluetooth:
1. Go to Bluetooth tab
2. Scan for devices
3. Connect to any device (or wait for simulated data)
4. Verify heart rate changes every 0.1 seconds
5. Verify accelerometer values update
6. Verify "Simulated Data" label appears if using simulated mode

### Test Stats:
1. Go to Stats tab
2. Scroll through all sections
3. Tap each chart to expand
4. Close expanded view
5. Tap "Add Data" button
6. Add a health metric
7. Tap "Manage" button
8. Delete a workout
9. Verify charts update

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Consistency:
- ‚úÖ Consistent color scheme across app
- ‚úÖ Shadow effects on cards and buttons
- ‚úÖ Rounded corners (12px standard)
- ‚úÖ Proper spacing and padding
- ‚úÖ No overlapping elements

### Interactions:
- ‚úÖ All buttons have touch feedback
- ‚úÖ Smooth animations and transitions
- ‚úÖ Clear loading states
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ‚úÖ Success/error alerts

### Accessibility:
- ‚úÖ Large touch targets (minimum 44x44pt)
- ‚úÖ Clear labels and icons
- ‚úÖ Proper contrast ratios
- ‚úÖ Readable font sizes

## üìù Notes

### Simulated Data:
The app now generates realistic health data for demonstration:
- **Steps:** 5,000-12,000 per day (7 days)
- **Heart Rate:** 60-95 BPM varying by time of day (24 hours)
- **Accelerometer:** ~1g on Z-axis (gravity) with small variations
- Clearly labeled as "Simulated Data" in UI

### Data Persistence:
Currently, data is stored in memory only. It will reset when app is closed.
For production, consider implementing:
- AsyncStorage for local persistence
- Cloud backup
- Export functionality

### Performance:
- Charts render efficiently with `react-native-chart-kit`
- Data updates throttled to prevent excessive re-renders
- Bluetooth data streams at 10Hz (10 updates per second)

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Bluetooth UUIDs are placeholders** - Update to match your Arduino firmware
2. **Data resets on app close** - No persistence implemented yet
3. **BLE requires dev build** - Won't work in Expo Go
4. **Chart animations** - May be slow on older devices

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Recommended:
1. Test on physical iOS and Android devices
2. Update Bluetooth UUIDs for your Arduino
3. Add data persistence (AsyncStorage)
4. Customize health metrics to your needs

### Optional Enhancements:
- Dark mode support
- Export data to CSV
- Social sharing features
- Goal setting and tracking
- Weekly/monthly reports
- Multiple device support

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed documentation
2. Review console logs for Bluetooth debugging
3. Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
4. Ensure development build created: `npx expo prebuild`
