## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Xcode (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)

### Installation Steps

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **For Expo Go (BLE not available):**
```bash
npm start
```
Note: Bluetooth features will show a message that development build is required.

3. **For Development Build (BLE enabled):**
```bash
# iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Android  
npx expo run:android
```

## 🤖 Arduino Nicla Sense ME Integration

### BLE Configuration

**Important:** Update UUIDs in `src/context/BluetoothContext.js` to match your Arduino firmware:

```javascript
// Line ~20-22
const NICLA_SENSE_SERVICE_UUID = '19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214';
const ACCELEROMETER_CHAR_UUID = '19b10001-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214';
```

### Features
- ✅ **Real-time scanning** for Arduino devices
- ✅ **Auto-filtering** for Nicla/Arduino devices
- ✅ **Connection management** with auto-reconnect
- ✅ **Live accelerometer data** streaming
- ✅ **Signal strength** monitoring
- ✅ **Error handling** with user-friendly alerts

### Data Format
Accelerometer data expected as:
- **6 bytes**: 3 x int16_t (X, Y, Z)
- **Scale**: Values multiplied by 1000 (e.g., 1.5g → 1500)
- **Endianness**: Little-endian

See `ARDUINO_SETUP.md` for complete Arduino firmware guide.

## 📊 Movement Trends Details

### Chart Types
1. **Line Chart** - Daily Steps
   - Bezier curves for smooth visualization
   - Shows 7 days/6 weeks/12 months depending on range
   
2. **Bar Chart** - Calories Burned
   - Color gradient from #FF6B35 to #FF8C5A
   
3. **Line Chart** - Active Minutes
   - Purple gradient (#AF52DE to #C77DFF)

### Metrics Displayed
- Average steps per day/period
- Average calories burned
- Total distance covered
- Average active minutes
- Trend indicators (up/down percentage)

## 🎨 Design Features

"infoPlist": {
  "NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription": "...",
  "NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription": "..."
}
```

### Android (app.json)
```json
"permissions": [
  "BLUETOOTH",
  "BLUETOOTH_ADMIN",
  "BLUETOOTH_CONNECT",
  "BLUETOOTH_SCAN",
  "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"
]
```

## 🚀 Running the App

### Development Mode (Expo Go)
```bash
npm start
```
- ✅ All UI features work
- ❌ Bluetooth scanning disabled (shows info message)
- ✅ Mock data for Movement Trends

### Development Build (Full Features)
```bash
# iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Android
npx expo run:android
```
- ✅ All features enabled
- ✅ Real Bluetooth scanning
- ✅ Arduino Nicla Sense ME connectivity

## 📝 Key Implementation Details

### Bluetooth Context (Graceful Degradation)
The app detects if BLE is available and gracefully degrades:

```javascript
// Conditional BLE import
try {
  const BleModule = require('react-native-ble-plx');
  BleManager = BleModule.BleManager;
} catch (e) {
  console.log('BLE not available');
  isBleAvailable = false;
}
```

When running in Expo Go, users see a helpful message with instructions to build the app.

### Movement Data Generation
Mock data is generated based on time range for demonstration:
- **Week**: 7 data points (daily)
- **Month**: 6 data points (5-day intervals)
- **Year**: 12 data points (monthly)

### Error Handling
- BLE connection failures show user-friendly alerts
- Permission denials provide guidance
- Device disconnections handled gracefully
- Scan timeouts prevent infinite scanning

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "BLE not available" message:**
- You're running in Expo Go
- Solution: Build development build with `npx expo run:ios`

**2. Arduino device not found:**
- Ensure Arduino is powered and advertising
- Check device name includes "Nicla" or "Arduino"
- Verify Bluetooth is enabled on phone

**3. No accelerometer data:**
- Update UUIDs in BluetoothContext.js
- Check Arduino firmware is sending NOTIFY characteristic
- Verify data format (6 bytes, little-endian)

**4. Build errors:**
- Run `npx expo prebuild --clean`
- Delete `ios/` and `android/` folders
- Run `npm install`
- Rebuild

### Debug Mode
Check console logs for:
- Available BLE services/characteristics
- Connection status
- Data parsing errors
- Permission issues

## 📈 Future Enhancements
